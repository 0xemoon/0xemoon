# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey! I'm **Emoon** — a passionate smart contract security researcher deeply focused on the **Solana blockchain** and **Rust-based smart contracts** 🦀. I spend most of my time exploring vulnerabilities, auditing high-performance protocols, and leveling up my skills every single day.

I believe security is not just about defense — it's about understanding things deeply enough to break and rebuild them better.

- 🔐 Specializing in **Solana Security**, **Rust Smart Contracts**, and **on-chain exploit research**
- 🧠 I learn 18+ hours daily to become one of the **top Solana Rust auditors**
- ⚙️ Always building, breaking, and learning — that's my cycle
